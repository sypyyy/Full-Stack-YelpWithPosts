# Full-Stack-YelpWithPosts
A full stack web project based on MERN stack. It has features such as business search, bookings and a post section.
**This is a web app project for learning purpose. The tech stacks involved in the project are html, scss, css, js, react, bootstrap, Node.js, Express, 
Mongodb Atlas, passport(for user authentication). 
The frontend layout was personally designed to be responsive and visually beautiful with smooth and performant animations, dark and light theme, and 
appropriate feedback messages for great user experience. 
The backend code is also well formed and organized for great readability.
